# Udagram Image Filtering Microservice

Udagram is a simple cloud application developed alongside the Udacity Cloud Engineering Nanodegree. It allows users to register and log into a web client, post photos to the feed, and process photos using an image filtering microservice.

The project is split into three parts:
1. [The Simple Frontend] A basic Ionic client web application which consumes the RestAPI Backend.
2. [The RestAPI Backend] A Node-Express server which can be deployed to a cloud service.
3. [The Image Filtering Microservice] The final project for the course. It is a Node-Express application which runs a simple script to process images.

## Deployment

The link to the Github repository of this project is: (https://github.com/joelchooks/cloud-developer/tree/master/course-02/project/image-filter-starter-code)


The deployed application for the final project can be found at (http://udagram-nwaoma-app-prod-dev.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com)

A sample query parameter to try the application out would be:(/filteredimage?image_url=https://images.pexels.com/photos/4629485/pexels-photo-4629485.jpeg)


This project demonstrates my ability to set up a client application and a corresponding RESTAPI Backend for consumption, while also demonstrating my ability to deploy a Node-Express server to the cloud.
